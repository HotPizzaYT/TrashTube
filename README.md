# How to install

Copy the files to your webserver under a folder named "tt". Then you want to extract vendor.zip to /tbh for thumbnail generation.
Then, DO NOT delete deleteme.txt, the installer will do it automaticly

Then you're good to go
# Thumbnail Generation
For thumbnail generation to work, you need two things: FFMpeg and FFProbe.

For Windows: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

For Linux: https://www.johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/



Linux users must download and extract the `tar.xz` from the site to `/opt/local/ffmpeg/bin/`.

For more information, please take a look at `IMPORTANT.txt` in `/thb`. Thank you.
