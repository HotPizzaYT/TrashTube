Welcome to HxTT news. This is version 1.6, and even though it might not have that many changes, they are big changes for sure.

Modified files:

upload.php
index.php
news.txt
view.php
location.php
search.php
accounts/*
channels.php
channel.php

Fixed a possible exploit in view.php. That means DO NOT USE THE OLDER VERSIONS!

Thumbnail generation now happens without user input regardless of whether or not the user wanted a thumbnail or not.
This can be turned off in upload.php.
