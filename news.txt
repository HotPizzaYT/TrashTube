Welcome to HxTT news. We have fixed numerous bugs in 1.1.

If you didn't notice, we also changed the max amount of characters a video ID can have.
Files updated in this update:
index.php
upload.php
view.php
addComment.php
Files added in this update:
news.txt
Files removed in this update:
NONE
(well technically, videos and ids, but that's beside the point)

Remember to add and change these files and publish them to GitHub.

Comments now have an id, for what reason, I do not yet know. But they will become useful over time and they're based on the ID of the video and which comment it is.
Links in descriptions and comments now properly display as a hyperlink.

Another thing that I would like to address is an upcoming feature called thumbnails. Every video that is uploaded will be proccessed by ffmpeg-php and screengrabbed right in the middle of whatever video it is. That is what this will make this TrashTube version a bit better than SudTube.

And finally but not least, uploaded videos no longer have a default comment.

And very soon in version 1.2 I will add in likes and dislikes to comments.
