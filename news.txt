Welcome to HxTT news. We have created a solution for custom timecode for generated thumbnails. Now you can use $_GET["tc"] for the time of the video.
Now, by default, thumbnails generate based on the middle of the video.


Changed and updated files:
addLike.php
addDislike.php
view.php
generateTN.php
news.txt


You may have noticed that we have also added a green and red bar for dislike and like ratios on videos.
<s>What do you think? Do you think we should swap the order of the colors to be like and dislike instead of dislike and like?</s>
I changed it so it won't bother anyone ;)

We've also added multilining in comments.
