I got a bit lazy uploading files, so you need to install composer on your computer and do the following commands

Open this folder in a command prompt/terminal.
Make sure you have composer installed, if you don't, you can get composer at http://getcomposer.org/

Type:
composer require php-ffmpeg/php-ffmpeg

Or you can extract vendor.zip. (Not here atm of writing)
