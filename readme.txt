If an uploaded video's ID begins with a dash or a symbol, remove it. It's glitched.

EDIT: This has been fixed.

IMPORTANT: Please put this entire thing in the root of your site files in a folder called "tt". Unless you want to edit 3 php files.
ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not place anything other than video json's in ids/. You'll glitch the homepage.
